# Development status

this is still very alpha.

The idea is to use generators to enable quick search through massive and multiple
histories.

I have methods to get history from zsh and bash.

## Pending features

- a config file somewhere in the users path to enable multiple history files

- a nice setup using pip, and publish in pypi

  - clarify if is "super advanced search" or "search all shells history"

- what about negative searches? It would be cool.
